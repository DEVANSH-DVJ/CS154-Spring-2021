Lab 10 Functions

We will do functions and higher order functions.

Write a program that prints unique words appearing in a text file with their frequency of occurrence
    using features discussed + file demo in python
      -- sets, membership "in", loops with element accesses, etc.
      -- try to avoid use of variables as much as possible

For example,
  if the text file contains
    hello
    hello how are you

  the program prints
    hello 2
    how 1
    are 1
    you 1
