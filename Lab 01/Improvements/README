Lab 1 Submission - Devansh Jain, 190100044

Core logic and working remains same but there have been some improvements:
1. In the previous submission, I had used C++ code in *.c files even though I had used procedural programming.
    I replaced it with proper C code and tested on the C compiler (gcc) instead of C++ compiler (g++)
2. I added comments at the start of every file, function, struct, class
3. Added the usage help output when number of command line arguments isn't correct.
4. Removed previously included but unnecessary headers
5. Renamed functions with long names to short, appropriate and understandable names.

To compile (on Linux):
gcc program1.c -o program1c;
g++ program1.cpp -o program1cpp;
gcc program2.c -o program2c;
g++ program2.cpp -o program2cpp;
