Difference between the "procedural" and "object oriented" paradigms as observed from sample.c and sample.cpp

1. sample.c ("procedural") is divided into functions, whereas
   sample.cpp ("object oriented") is divided into classes (which has member functions).

2. There is no access specifier in procedural programming (sample.c),
   Object oriented programming have access specifiers like private, public, protected etc. (sample.cpp)
