Lab 12: Logic Programming Paradigm

Type out all programs in the slide
1) fix errors,
2) generate inf recursions to understand where it can go wrong.
    solve them to eliminate inf recursion by re-writing/re-engineering programs
3) Try using cut operator (if time permits)

Submit: programs, re-engineering programs, observations
