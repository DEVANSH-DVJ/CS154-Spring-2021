prog1.cpp
Compilation Error:
  "error: cannot declare variable ‘a’ to be of abstract type ‘A’"
Explanation:
  A has a pure virtual function and thus is an abstract class, it can not be instantiated as "A a;".

prog2.cpp
Output (Runtime Error):
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
Explanation:
  "ap" is a pointer which isn't assigned any object, so calling a function is invalid access, so it throws Seg fault.

prog3.cpp
Output:
  B::f
  B:g
  B::f
  B:g
Explanation:
  "ap" is a pointer of type Class A pointing to object of Class B.
  "b" is object of Class B.
  "ap->f()", "ap->g()" are valid as Class A has declaration of "f()" & "g()". As Class B has definition of "f()" & "g()", they are called.
  "b.f()" & "b.g()" are valid as Class B has declaration of "f()" & "g()". As Class B has definition of "f()" & "g()", they are called.

Explanation:
  "ap" is a pointer of type Class A pointing to object of Class A.
  "ap->f()", "ap->g()" are valid as Class A has declaration of "f()" & "g()". As Class A has definition of "f()" & "g()", they are called.
  "ap->f()" calls "g()" which is equivalent to "this->g()" which is equivalent to "ap->g()". (First two lines of output)
  "cp" is a pointer of type Class C pointing to object of Class C.
  "cp->f()", "cp->g()", "cp->k()" are valid as Class C has declaration of "f()" & "k()" and parent Class A has declaration of "g()". As Class C has definition of "f()" & "k()", they are called. As Class C doesn't have definition of "g()" but parent Class A has, it is called.
  "cp->k()" calls "f()" which is equivalent to "this->f()" which is equivalent to "cp->f()". (Sixth and Seventh lines of output)
  After "ap = cp;",
  "ap" is a pointer of type Class A pointing to object of Class C.
  "ap->f()", "ap->g()" are valid as Class A has declaration of "f()" & "g()". As Class C has definition of "f()", it is called. As Class C doesn't have definition of "g()" but parent Class A has, it is called.
  "bp" is an unassigned pointer and thus can't be accessed to be copied to "ap", so "ap = bp;" is invalid access, so it throws Seg fault.

  To access A's over-ridden "f()", we use A::f().
  "a" is object of Class A, with A::x=1.
  "b" is object of Class B, with B::x=2.
  "c" is object of Class C, with C::y=3, B::x=13, A::x=103.
