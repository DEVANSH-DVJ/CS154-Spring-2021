Lab 9 Expressions

complex.cpp
  add a couple of your own operators to the complex class, and modify main to test them

collection.cpp
  1) add a bulk insertion operation to class collection which will merge another collection into it
  2) add >> operator to class collection to fetch elements from it (last in first out)

For the rest of the programs,
  observe their behavior one by one,
  make some changes to them,
  compute the output before you run the programs,
  and verify if you get it right.
  Write about your changes and reasons for what you observe.

Takeaways:
  different kinds of expressions,
  operators,
  user defined operators,
  cascading/nesting of expressions/operators,
  associativity,
  precedence,
  parameter evaluation order.
