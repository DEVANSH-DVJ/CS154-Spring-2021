Using Object-oriented Paradigm.
There are two classes - Lift and Floor.

Lift has a list of all floors waiting for up and down along with a list of destinations in form of bool arrays.
When it reaches a floor, it checks if it has to open or not.
If it opens, then it calls the floor's function lift_opens() which returns destinations of passengers getting in.
It also has a private variable dir which shows the direction of motion. 1: Up, -1: Down, 0: Stationary

Floor has waiting list for destinations of passengers wanting to go up and down.
Whenever up/down button is pressed, it signals the lift closest to it to register it in the wait list.
When lift_opens() is called, it returns list of destinations of passengers getting in.

Modifications and features which can be added:
1. the additional feature for limit on number of passengers can be easily met
    with the lift keeping a tab of passengers, and
    lift_opens() taking an additional parameter which contains maximum new entrants
    this can be easily be made possible using pop_front() function of list<uint>
2. Multi-lift is also easily implementable by calculating the nearest lift considering the direction it is moving,
    and then assigning the corresponding lift the floor.
