Lab 12: Logic Programming Paradigm

We explore ideas in LP through prolog

Write predicates for the following:

1. Find if a list is palindrome

2. Reverse a list

3. Count how many times an element appears in a list

4. Is a list a substring in another?

5. Append a list at the back of another

6. Find minimum element in a list

7. Find factorial
