I have implemented append as app in app.pl
However, I have directly used append, an in-built predicate,
  for pal.pl, rev.pl, sub.pl

All the predicates have same name as the file
For making an executable: gplc <predicate>.pl
It will create an executable <predicate>
To run the executable: ./<predicate>

The usage and description of the logic for the recursive relation
  are present in .pl files
